--- How to install ScriptDev2 ---

1) Download MaNGOS (using git clone)
See their forum/ wiki for more details

2) Do the source stuff:
- Clone ScriptDev2 "git clone git://github.com/scriptdev2/scriptdev2.git ScriptDev2" - execute from within src/bindings directory

MS Windows:
- Compile ScriptDev2 using the scriptVC80, scriptVC90 or scriptVC100 Solution within the ScriptDev2 folder (this will overwrite the Mangoscript dll in the output directory)

GNU/Linux or CMake:
- Apply the Git patch to Mangos - "git am src/bindings/ScriptDev2/patches/MaNGOS-XXXX-ScriptDev2.patch"
- Compile MaNGOS (ScriptDev2 will automatically be built when compiling Mangos from here on)


3) Create the default ScriptDev2 database using
   "sql\scriptdev2_create_database.sql", then execute
   "sql\scriptdev2_create_structure.sql" on that database.

4) Execute the following on your ScriptDev2 database.
- sql\scriptdev2_script_full.sql

5) Execute the following file on your MaNGOS database.
- sql\mangos_scriptname_full.sql

6) Place the included "scriptdev2.conf" file within the directory containing your "mangosd.conf" and "realmd.conf" files. You may need to change this file to match the database you created and any custom settings you wish to use. Note this file will be different created for Unix based systems.

7) Run mangosd from your output directory


To update ScriptDev2:
- Enter src/bindings/ScriptDev2 directory (with git-bash)
- Update ScriptDev2 - "git pull"

MS Windows:
- You must still compile MaNGOS before ScriptDev2 when on the Windows platform.

To update your Database with new Scriptdev2 SQL changes you can either:
a) apply only the changes that were made during that revision by looking in the sql\update folder or (files named rXXX_scriptdev2.sql should be executed on the scriptdev2 db while rXXX_mangos.sql should be executed on your mangos db)
b) reapply "mangos_scriptname_full.sql" to your MaNGOS database. - WARNING this will NOT include removed script names!
